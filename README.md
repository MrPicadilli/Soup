# My Amazing Project : Soup

This project was created during my scholarship on a team of 5 to make a game in Unity. This is a cozy game 2D/3D which is centered on UI interaction.

The story is that you are a soup enjoyer in a village where he will invite some people to enjoy some soup each night. For that he will have to got to the market to buy some ingredients, invite the person he wants to eat with, prepare the soup by cutting/grinding ingredients and then eat the soup with the guest. You will also be able to follow the reaction of your guest and note what are his preferences to be able one day to know every villagers favorite soup.
